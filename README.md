# 四体 - shitai

Project restarted as of 4th May 2020.
LEGACY has been ported to x86_64 Architecture, added Linux support along with support for portable build environment.
There are absolutely no changes to the code, the point of the restart is to remake the rendering engine. 

### Features I want to add.

A simple rendering engine with support for 3D made using OpenGL using SDL2 and Glew.
Resolution should be selectable without messing with the media dependencies (scaled automatically to frames).
